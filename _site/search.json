    "text": "Code book\nWhereas general metadata and README information typically focuses on the data set or project as a whole, code books delve deeper, providing detailed explanations and clarifications about the specific data contained in individual files. A code book should make all components of a data set file self-explanatory. It helps to identify e.g what certain variables and value labels mean or in which format the data points have been collected. This makes the data set more accessible by allowing re-users to work independent of a research paper.Some people include this information in the README file. However, we advise against it to keep the README concise and maintain its readability.\nIf all of your data files are structured and labeled according to the same system it is enough to provide one code book that describes and explain this system. If you have differently structured files you should provide multiple code books.\nHere are some of the elements that can be included in a code book:\n\nvariables\nvalue labels\ndata types\ndata format\ndata dictionary\ndata quality notes\ntechnical info\n\n\nBasic level:\nA first step is to provide this information about your data in a .csv table, a .txt file or .md (markdown) file.

This provides the advantage to be machine-readable and -actionable.

    "section": "Metadata",
    "text": "Metadata\nMetadata is “data that provides information about other data”1, describing the context, content, and structure of a dataset. It contains essential information about the data, such as authorship, creation context, contents, provenance and accessibility. Making it possible to understand and work with the data effectively. By providing a clear understanding of the data’s origin, and meaning, metadata plays a critical role in ensuring data quality, reproducibility, and FAIRness.\nMetadata should provide answers to the following questions:\n\nWho created the data set?\nWhat do the data files contain?\nWhen was the data set generated?\nWhere was the data set generated?\nWhy was the data set generated?\nHow was the data set generated?\nWhat research is this data set connected to?\nCan this data set be re-used?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask X:\n\n\n\nCan you answer all of these questions by looking through your (example) data set?\nWhere did you find this information?\nWas everything readily understandable?\nBonus:\nTime yourself - how long does it take you to answer all questions?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to learn more about where to find metadata\n\n\n\n\n\nMetadata can be found at several different points:\n\nRepository description: You are often asked about entering metadata, when you upload your data set to a repository. The quality and extent of metadata you can provide varies from repository to repository. We will cover repositories in Chapter 3). Jump here to go to the chapter directly.\nREADME file: Before you publish your data set you might already want to keep track of your metadata. A good way to not loose the overview yourself and inform others is by creating a README file. We will cover README files in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcursion: Community Standards\n\n\n\nCommunity standards for metadata allow for improved comparison between data sets. Some disciplines have agreed-upon formal standards that define how metadata should be documented. If you publish your data via a discipline specific repository it is likely that their form already guides you through the community metadata standard. You can look for metadata standards that are specific to your discipline e.g. via FAIRsharing.org. If a standard for your research field exist you should follow it as best as possible.\nEven if your discipline does not adhere to strict standards, there is an advantage in using generic standards. By using controlled vocabularies or ontologies for your metadata you can increase the machine-readability and -actionability of your data.\nMachine-readability refers to the ability of machines (computers, algorithms, etc.) to automatically understand and interpret the meaning of metadata, such as keywords, descriptions, and concepts, without human intervention. Machine-actionability takes it a step further, enabling machines to not only understand the metadata but also to perform actions or take decisions based on that metadata, such as data integration, filtering, or visualization, without human intervention.",

They form a great way to provide an introduction to and documentation about a data set and its research context. A README file is a plain text file often written in markdown and therefore named “README.md”. This naming convention helps spotting the README file for humans and machines alike, e.g. in GitHub repositories the README.md file is identified automatically and its content displayed on the repositories main page. The README file should be one of the first files your create for a new project. You can then continue filling it with the relevant information.\nWhat should be in a README file? - Ideally all the answers to the questions posed under the metadata section should be given in the README file. To determine what should be best included in your README file it can also be helpful to go through the questions of a Research Data Management Plan. While your README file should be very descriptive it is also important to stay concise and clear. Avoid e.g. using jargon to improve inter-disciplinary usage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask Y:\n\n\n\nOption 1: Your (example) data set does not contain a README file\n\nCreate a README file using the template below in a text editor of your choice.\nFill out as much information as possible according to the metadata provided.\nMake note of the information that was difficult to obtain.\nUpload the file to your group folder.\n\nOption 2: Your (example) data set does contain a README file\n\nDownload and open the README file in a text editor of your choice.\nWhere does the provided information differ from the template below?

    "text": "License\nIf we in the end would like to share our research data and enable reuse for other researchers, we should keep in mind that our data might be protected by copyright law. This depends on the level of originality in the data and here it is very important to differentiate between the instrument and the data. If you developed a comprehensive questionnaire or an elaborate fMRI task then this is the thing that ought to be protected whereas the data are most likely not. In any case, you should define conditions under which the data can be reused. And this is actually where licenses come into play. Licenses are in a way standard contracts that regulate usage rights for published work. And as I already mentioned, thereby enables other people to reuse the published work. If no license is provided with your dataset, it is not clear to others under which conditions they can reuse it and they might (against your good intentions) rather refrain from reusing it at all. There are several licenses out there, as e.g. Creative Commons, MIT (software), Apache (software), Open Data Commons. Rules of thumb: Go with the least restrictive license! CC0 if unsure of copyright CC-BY if holding and insisting on copyright Public Domain Mark if not protected by copyright\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask X:\n\n\n\nAre you actually allowed to reuse your data set? \\ If so, under which conditions?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcursion: Creative Commons licences\n\n\n\nFrom our point of view the creative commons licenses are somewhat dominating in the area of research and we will therefore go into a little bit of detail on these. CC provides four features, which form the basis of a fixed set of six CC licenses. These are attribution (the obligation to credit the author and other parties designated for attribution); “ND” means NoDerivatives (only verbatim copies of the work can be shared); “NC” stands for NonCommercial (commercial use is excluded from the license grant and “SA” represents ShareAlike (i.e. the work can be modified and modified versions can be published but only under the original or a compatible license). And these are the 6 licenses that result from the combination of the four features. The least restrictive is the CC BY license: It grants an unrestricted license to use the respective content. How the content is used, e.g. in original or modified form, by whom or for what purpose, is irrelevant. In addition, there are 2 further labels, to dedicate the published work to the public domain, these are CC0 and the public domain mark. When you put your work under CC0 you are allowing others to reuse your work without conditions, so even if you were copyright holder you are not insisting on it. I do want to stress at this point that the good scientific practice obviously foresee that you will in any case credit the author of the work, so in a way, this would be the preferred option. And then there is the Public domain mark which can be used to label work that is not restricted by copyright.\nTo help you decide on a licence, the is Choo-choo-choose your license.",
