This material was created for the LMU & MPG Open Science Summer School 2024. During the Summer School the material was accompanied by slides and the tasks were done in groups. Independent of this event, the materials can be used to get an insight into Research Data Management in the context of Open Science and therefore with the goal of a FAIR publication. 

This version of the material has been updated by the same group of creators for the MPG Open Science Ambassadors Meeting 2024. All self-paced training elements remain.
